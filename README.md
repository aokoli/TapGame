TapGame
=======

TapGame is an Android-based game where the player taps monsters on the screen to destroy them. 
A score is assigned to the player dependent on how quickly all monsters on the screen are destroyed. 
The monsters alternate between a protected state (holding a shield) and a vulnerable state (no shield).
